Current Status:
((and accompanying thoughts for improvement))

After coming back to this project almost four months latter, I am pretty impressed with how it looks. I feel like I lost some of my lust for a good design and being nit picky with it over the past couple of months. I could stand to be more nit picky.
That being said... While this looks good on mobile for one phone size, and the desktop of my size it's not super dynamic in it's formatting.
I didn't have access bootstrap at the time that I first made this and I use that for everything I do.
Which is probably why my color scheming is so boring in my other projects, because I have to program it into the root of every sass file and its honestly just quicker to use the basic colors that bootstrap gives you. 
that being said. taking thirty minutes on my next project to write up those variables might just be worth it. (Something to keep in mind is that I have also been using the base template's colors because they are really easily themed to light and dark and any color I add in wouldn't be dynamic unless I made it that way)

Goal: 
Make my checkpoint_wk1 project into a nice cover page to show case favorite projects

TODO List:

Hide hovered textbox on mobile
add a unique CSS animation

make my hamburger menu (mobile nav) a functional dropdown. 
  multiple dropdowns - One for on page navigation and one for links to Favorite Personal Projects
make my form submit an email to myself (stretch goal)
  -- Make another form to submit reviews (would need a backend and to host it)
format quote cards to incorporate tablet size.
